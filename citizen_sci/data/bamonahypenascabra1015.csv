I live in Haddonfield on a quiet dead end street.  Located on a inter coastal flood plain.  One hundred years ago, a former farm that became subdivided and turned into suburbia.  My back yard contains one mature pin oak, Black Cherry trees American Holly, Blue Atlas Cedar and Dogwood. Smaller item include Butterfly bush, Mt Laurel and rodadendren, Evening Primrose, tropical milkweed and some mint.   In the closer vicinity are hemlock, spruce, beech, tulip, sweet gum, sycamore, maple and some pine trees.  At the end of my street (200 yds away) is Cooper Park that contains Cooper Creek. and across the street from me is a deep ravine with a feeder stream to the creek. It was at this location in 1858 Hadrosaurus foulkii was discovered in a marl pit.  Most of the plants are what the owners planted. The natural growing plants and trees are in the floodplain and ravine.  Also at the end of the block (a former sewer plant) is a small field in transition. There are grasses and shrubs and young trees.","Attracted to light.","Chip Krilowicz (2632)","","","06/11/2013 10:19:25"
