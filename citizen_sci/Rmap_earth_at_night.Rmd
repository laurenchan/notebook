## Testing ability to plot earth at night data

Load libraries. Don't need all of these. I think this really is only using `rgdal`, `raster`, and maybe `sp`.
```{r echo=FALSE}
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(viridis)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Plot Earth at Night Map for Globe

Downloaded full res from [https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights/page3.php](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights/page3.php)

```{r}
us.lights <- raster("BlackMarble_2016_3km_geo.tif")
plot(us.lights)
```

## Next step

Change colors.
Also, pull data from point or areas of map.
